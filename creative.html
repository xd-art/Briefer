        <p>
            Project management has evolved so much over the years that it’s spun off into so many different techniques and methodologies. And each interesting methodology has its own set of rules and processes involved. </p>

           <p> <b>Here are the top 5 project management techniques:</b></p>

            <ul>

                <li> <a href="#"> Waterfall</a>: breaks down the software development process into 6 phases; requirements, analysis, design, coding, testing, and acceptance</li>
                <li> <a href="#">Agile project management</a>: includes the client in the software development process </li>
                <li><a href="#"> Scrum project management</a>: the most popular subset of Agile project management which involves self-organized Scrum teams </li>
                <li> <a href="#">GTD (Get Things Done)</a>: helps prioritize your team’s work efficiently</li>
                <li><a href="#">Critical Path Method</a>: helps the team identifies the most important tasks that need to be completed.</li>

            </ul>
            
         <p>   The need to quantify, objectify, segregate and delegate tasks properly and proportionately is of high importance and that’s where the use of modern tools comes in. There’s a lot of project management tools out there, and if you’re new to project management, it can be hard to identify what’s essential, what’s beneficial, and what’s not worth your time.</p>
